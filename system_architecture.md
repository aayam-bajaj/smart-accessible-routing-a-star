## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as Web Interface
    participant R as Routing Service
    participant A as A* Algorithm
    participant M as Map Data
    participant L as ML Models

    U->>W: Request route with preferences
    W->>R: Process route request
    R->>A: Initiate route calculation
    A->>M: Retrieve map data
    A->>L: Get ML-enhanced costs
    A->>A: Calculate optimal route
    A->>R: Return route result
    R->>W: Format response
    W->>U: Display route options
    U->>W: Provide feedback
    W->>L: Update training data
```

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.8+
- Flask web framework
- NetworkX for graph processing
